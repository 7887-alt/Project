**Code Collaboration WebApp**

**Introduction:**
Our Code Collaboration WebApp allows multiple users to collaborate in real-time on a shared notepad. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WebSocket technology, this application provides a seamless and interactive platform for teams to write, edit, and view code simultaneously.

**Features:**

##Real-Time Collaboration: Users can see changes made by other collaborators in real-time, enabling seamless teamwork and communication.
WebSocket Integration: The WebSocket protocol facilitates instant communication between the server and clients, ensuring synchronized updates across all connected devices.
Syntax Highlighting: Enhance code readability with syntax highlighting, making it easier for users to identify different programming elements.
User Presence Indication: Visual cues indicate the presence of other users, allowing collaborators to know who else is currently viewing or editing the document.
Version History: Access previous versions of the document to track changes and revert to earlier states if needed, ensuring data integrity and collaboration transparency.
Customizable Themes: Choose from a selection of themes to personalize the appearance of the notepad, catering to individual preferences and enhancing user experience.
How It Works:

**Initialization:** Upon accessing the web application, users are greeted with a blank notepad interface ready for collaboration.
WebSocket Connection: The application establishes a WebSocket connection with the server, enabling real-time communication between users.
Collaborative Editing: Users can type, edit, and delete text within the notepad, with changes instantly reflected for all connected collaborators.
User Presence: A user list or indicator displays the presence of other collaborators, allowing for awareness of concurrent editing activity.
Syntax Highlighting: The application applies syntax highlighting to code snippets, improving readability and comprehension for all users.
Version Control: Accessible version history allows users to review past edits, facilitating collaboration and maintaining document integrity.

**Implementation:**

**Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript):**
HTML provides the structure of the web application, defining the layout and components.
CSS styles the user interface, enhancing aesthetics and usability.
JavaScript handles client-side interactions, including WebSocket communication and DOM manipulation for real-time updates.
**Backend (WebSocket Server):**
The WebSocket server facilitates bidirectional communication between clients, transmitting and receiving messages to synchronize collaborative edits.
Implemented using WebSocket libraries/frameworks in a server-side programming language (e.g., Node.js, Python, etc.).
