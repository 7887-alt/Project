<h3>Code Collaboration WebApp</h3>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong><br>
Our Code Collaboration WebApp allows multiple users to collaborate in real-time on a shared notepad. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WebSocket technology, this application provides a seamless and interactive platform for teams to write, edit, and view code simultaneously.</p>

<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Real-Time Collaboration:</strong> Users can see changes made by other collaborators in real-time, enabling</li>
  <li><strong>WebSocket Integration:</strong> The WebSocket protocol facilitates instant communication between the server and clients, ensuring synchronized updates across all connected devices.</li>
  <li><strong>Syntax Highlighting:</strong> Enhance code readability with syntax highlighting, making it easier for users to identify different programming elements.</li>
  <li><strong>User Presence Indication:</strong> Visual cues indicate the presence of other users, allowing collaborators to know who else is currently viewing or editing the document.</li>
  <li><strong>Version History:</strong> Access previous versions of the document to track changes and revert to earlier states if needed, ensuring data integrity and collaboration transparency.</li>
  <li><strong>Customizable Themes:</strong> Choose from a selection of themes to personalize the appearance of the notepad, catering to individual preferences and enhancing user experience.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Initialization:</strong> Upon accessing the web application, users are greeted with a blank notepad interface ready for collaboration.</li>
  <li><strong>WebSocket Connection:</strong> The application establishes a WebSocket connection with the server, enabling real-time communication between users.</li>
  <li><strong>Collaborative Editing:</strong> Users can type, edit, and delete text within the notepad, with changes instantly reflected for all connected collaborators.</li>
  <li><strong>User Presence:</strong> A user list or indicator displays the presence of other collaborators, allowing for awareness of concurrent editing activity.</li>
  <li><strong>Syntax Highlighting:</strong> The application applies syntax highlighting to code snippets, improving readability and comprehension for all users.</li>
  <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Accessible version history allows users to review past edits, facilitating collaboration and maintaining document integrity.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Implementation:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript):</strong><br>
HTML provides the structure of the web application, defining the layout and components.<br>
CSS styles the user interface, enhancing aesthetics and usability.<br>
JavaScript handles client-side interactions, including WebSocket communication and DOM manipulation for real-time updates.</p>

<p><strong>Backend (WebSocket Server):</strong><br>
The WebSocket server facilitates bidirectional communication between clients, transmitting and receiving messages to synchronize collaborative edits.<br>
Implemented using WebSocket libraries/frameworks in a server-side programming language (e.g., Node.js, Python, etc.).</p>
